## A Pacific Playlist

**What does the Pacific Ocean sound like to you?**

Surf rock blaring from a radio?

A ukulele strummed at a family gathering?

The sugar rush of a pop ballad?

Belonging? Nostalgia?

Pleasure? Pain?

### Surfin' USA by The Beach Boys (from Amera) 
*[Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/surfin-u-s-a/1443101236?i=1443101252) \- [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/2EPr9Wx7e1cpGEbNAtuN7x?si=b2e3c507e8a042f5) \- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0bhSGfKTs4)*

No other musical piece captures the excitement and sunny glory that is the Pacific Ocean better than “Surfin’ USA” by The Beach Boys as both the ease and vibrant imagery of the lyrics work to address the Pacific Ocean’s influential power over the cultural landscape of California. From the vibrant energy to the tranquil qualities of calm composure, to the ominous undertones of mystery, the Pacific Ocean embodies an array of moods, meaning, and purpose. The Beach Boys’ “Surfin’ USA” emphasizes the vivacious side commonly associated with the Pacific Ocean and verbalizes such geographical entity’s broader influence.

With a first listen, this song brings an upbeat energy that makes you want to get on your feet and dance, not just anywhere though, in the sun wallowing under California’s exceptionally strong rays of light. The Beach Boys offer insight into the stereotyped “high life” that is living in sunny California, mainly credited to the bonus of premiere access to the Surfin’ USA culture supplied by the Pacific Ocean. Verse 1 begins with, “if everybody had an ocean” (0.02-0.04) immediately addressing and assuming that all desire and envy the beach lifestyle. The elite attributes the Beach Boys utilize to describe the Pacific Ocean further contributes to the exclusivity surrounding the desirably perfectly picturesque perceptions the general person has of California. The Beach Boys effectively capture the incomparable energy that the Pacific Ocean offers through this upbeat joyous song that celebrates the carefree surf culture of California. The song then progresses to acknowledge the casual way of life associated with surf culture, “You’d see them wearing their baggies, Huarache sandals too, A bushy bushy blond hairdo” (0.14-0.22). These stereotyped surfer traits relate to the laidback fashion trends that help to sculpt the overall casual culture of the California environment. The rarity of such ideal year-round weather offered in California serves especially advantageous as many other coastal places experience all four seasons restricting their optimization of ocean use. The constant “vacation” climate of California allows for consistent casual summer attire. Despite California having its superficial traits, the close proximity to nature creates for greater emphasis placed on the comfort and quality of life. Somehow the smooth agility and calming qualities of the ocean water transcribes into the general eased environment that characterizes the west coast. This starkly contrasts the intensity of the rushed lifestyle affiliated with the east coast. For many, this idealized escape from life’s stressors becomes a reality in the form of California with the Pacific Ocean serving as an outlet.

The dominant role the simple existence of the ocean plays on the identity of its geographical neighbors expands beyond just California. The unified identity of other bordering lands is highlighted in lines, “You’d catch ‘em surfin’ at Del Mar, Ventura County line... Australia’s Narrabean” (0.27-0.36). Such accessibility to this landmark translates to the general persona commonly found among such indulgers of the Pacific breeze unintentionally uniting these shared identities, qualities, and lifestyles. Such lifestyle expands beyond just a list of places, but all who are culturally influenced by the ocean’s presence. Verse 2 continues by emphasizing the excitement placed around summer and its associated characteristics. The line, “tell the teacher we’re surfin’”(1.09-1.12) reestablishes the greater emphasis placed on surf culture over education and the skew of values fostered solely in response to the Pacific Ocean’s cultural dominance. Overall, the Pacific Ocean withholds are particular cultural power beyond physical land barriers that few can articulate.

The Beach Boys effectively capture the incomparable energy that the Pacific Ocean offers through this upbeat joyous song that celebrates the carefree surf culture of California. Such iconic song deserves a place on the course playlist as it encapsulates the unique spirit of the Pacific Ocean and its dominant presence on the places it accompanies.
